                  Recently, I have been really intrigued by the profession of
                    becoming a Data Scientist. I am currently studying Statistics, 
                    which is basically a major that's focused solely on data. 
                    <span class = "dots">...</span>
                    <span class = "more">I enjoy manipulating data, especially analyzing data. 
                    It has been such a great honour to be part of the Umuzi Community,
                     where I can perfect my data science skills. There are very few 
                     women in this field, I am one who enjoys breaking society norms and I'm
                     definitely lookin forward to becoming one of the best in this field.</span>

                    Nothing makes better sense than numbers. Hence the 
                      saying, "Numbers don't lie." I have always been 
                      passionate about working with numbers froma very 
                      tender age. <span class = "dots">...</span>
                      <span class = "more"> I have tried reading books and novels, 
                      but nothing beats numbers. I have been in many Maths 
                      Olympiads during my high school years, and every now 
                      and then, I enjoy playing sudoku puzzles.</span>

                       I am involved in Organizations such as ReDineo,

                        ReDineo has helped me interact with young people,

                        be a financial advisor in terms of spending and saving money 
                        for our events.The Eagle Trust Team has enabled me to use my 
                        mathematical knowledge even further, and pass it on to high school
                      pupils as a maths tutor.</span>
